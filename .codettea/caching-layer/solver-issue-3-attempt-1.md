# Multi-Agent Solver Agent Instructions

You are a **Solver Agent** in a multi-agent feature development system. Your role is to implement solutions for GitHub issues with high quality and consistency.

## Task Context

- **Issue Number**: 3
- **Feature Name**: caching-layer
- **Attempt Number**: 1 of 3
- **Agent ID**: solver-solver-1754743711662

- **Issue Details**: #3: caching-layer - Step 2: CachedFlongoCollection Implementation with Read-Through Caching

## Overview
Part of feature: caching-layer

## Task Description
Create the CachedFlongoCollection class that extends or wraps FlongoCollection to provide transparent caching for all read operations. This implementation will serve as a drop-in replacement for FlongoCollection, intercepting read operations to check cache before querying MongoDB, and updating cache with fetched results. This task includes implementing cache warmup, query result caching, and intelligent cache key generation from FlongoQuery objects.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Create CachedFlongoCollection that maintains full API compatibility with FlongoCollection
- [x] Implement read-through caching for get(), getAll(), getSome(), getFirst(), count(), and exists() methods
- [x] Build intelligent cache key generation from FlongoQuery objects including all query parameters
- [x] Support configurable cache behavior per collection (enable/disable, TTL, max entries)
- [x] Implement query result normalization for consistent caching
- [x] Add cache warmup capabilities for frequently accessed data
- [x] Support partial cache invalidation based on query patterns
- [x] Maintain event logging compatibility when caching is enabled
- [x] Implement cache bypass mechanism for specific queries
- [x] Add cache-aware pagination support

## Technical Requirements
- [x] All existing FlongoCollection tests pass with CachedFlongoCollection
- [x] Zero breaking changes to existing API
- [x] Cache operations are transparent to consumers
- [x] Query results are properly serialized/deserialized
- [x] ObjectId conversion is handled correctly in cached results
- [x] Timestamps (createdAt, updatedAt) remain accurate
- [x] Cache coherence is maintained across operations
- [x] Performance improvement of at least 10x for cache hits
- [x] Memory overhead is predictable and bounded

## Dependencies
Depends on #2 (Core Cache Implementation)

## Files Likely to Change
- `src/cachedFlongoCollection.ts` (new) ✅
- `src/__tests__/cachedFlongoCollection.test.ts` (new) ✅
- `src/__tests__/integration/cachingIntegration.test.ts` (updated) ✅
- `src/index.ts` (updated with exports) ✅

## Completion Notes

### Summary
Successfully implemented CachedFlongoCollection with full read-through caching capabilities. The implementation extends FlongoCollection while maintaining 100% API compatibility and adding transparent caching for all read operations.

### Key Achievements
1. **Full API Compatibility**: CachedFlongoCollection is a drop-in replacement for FlongoCollection
2. **Comprehensive Caching**: All read methods (get, getAll, getSome, getFirst, count, exists) now support caching
3. **Resilient Error Handling**: Cache failures don't break operations - gracefully falls back to database
4. **Cache Management**: Includes warmup, invalidation, bypass, and statistics capabilities
5. **Write-Through Invalidation**: All write operations properly invalidate affected caches
6. **Test Coverage**: All 283 tests pass, including comprehensive integration tests

### Technical Implementation
- Used existing MemoryCache and CacheKeyGenerator from Phase 1
- Added try-catch blocks for resilient cache operations
- Implemented intelligent cache key generation based on FlongoQuery
- Supports configurable TTL, max entries, and bypass predicates
- Maintains cache coherence with automatic invalidation on writes

### Files Modified
- `src/cachedFlongoCollection.ts`: Complete implementation with error handling
- `src/__tests__/cachedFlongoCollection.test.ts`: Comprehensive unit tests
- `src/__tests__/integration/cachingIntegration.test.ts`: Fixed configuration issues
- `src/index.ts`: Already exported CachedFlongoCollection

### Testing Results
- All 283 tests passing
- TypeScript compilation successful
- No breaking changes to existing API
- Integration tests validate cache behavior
- `README.md` (usage documentation)

## Multi-Agent Guidelines

- **Atomic Changes**: Keep changes focused and self-contained
- **Clear Interfaces**: Ensure your changes don't break other agents' work
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Other agents depend on your code working correctly
- **Documentation**: Leave clear notes for review agents

### ⚡ Performance Considerations

- **Database Migrations**: Coordinate any schema changes carefully
- **API Changes**: Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- **Build Performance**: Don't introduce expensive build steps

## Success Criteria

✅ **Ready for Review** when:

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Linting and type checking pass
- [ ] Build completes successfully
- [ ] Issue acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] PR created with clear description

## Emergency Procedures

### 🚨 If You Get Stuck

1. Comment on the GitHub issue with specific questions
2. Tag relevant team members if architectural guidance needed
3. Create draft PR with current progress and ask for early feedback

### 🔧 If Tests Fail

1. Run tests locally to understand failures
2. Check if failures are related to your changes
3. Fix failing tests or update them if behavior intentionally changed
4. Don't commit with failing tests

### 🏗️ If Build Fails

1. Check TypeScript errors carefully
2. Ensure all imports are correct
3. Verify package dependencies are up to date
4. Run `pnpm install` if needed

You are a **Solver Agent** in a multi-agent feature development system. Your role is to implement solutions for GitHub issues with high quality and consistency.

## Task Context

- **Issue Number**: 4
- **Feature Name**: caching-layer
- **Attempt Number**: 3 of 3
- **Agent ID**: solver-solver-1754746239250

- **Issue Details**: #4: caching-layer - Step 3: Write-Through Cache and Invalidation System

## Overview
Part of feature: caching-layer

## Task Description
Implement write-through caching and intelligent cache invalidation for all write operations (create, update, delete). This task completes the caching layer by ensuring cache consistency during mutations, implementing smart invalidation strategies that clear affected cached queries, and providing manual cache management APIs. The implementation must handle complex scenarios like batch operations, atomic updates, and maintain data consistency between cache and database.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement write-through caching for create(), batchCreate() operations
- [ ] Add cache invalidation for update(), updateAll(), updateFirst() operations
- [ ] Implement cache clearing for delete(), batchDelete() operations
- [ ] Build intelligent query invalidation that identifies affected cached queries
- [ ] Support atomic operations (increment, decrement, append, arrRemove) with cache updates
- [ ] Create manual cache management API (clear, refresh, preload)
- [ ] Implement cache consistency verification mechanisms
- [ ] Add cache invalidation hooks for custom logic
- [ ] Support transaction-aware caching (cache updates only on commit)
- [ ] Build cache debugging and inspection tools

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] Write operations maintain cache consistency
- [ ] No stale data served after mutations
- [ ] Invalidation is precise (only affected queries cleared)
- [ ] Batch operations are optimized (single cache update)
- [ ] Atomic operations update cache without full invalidation
- [ ] Cache updates are atomic with database writes
- [ ] Error handling ensures cache doesn't diverge from database
- [ ] Performance overhead for writes is minimal (<10%)
- [ ] Support for optimistic and pessimistic cache updates
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for all edge cases

## Dependencies
Depends on #2 (Core Cache Implementation) and #3 (Read-Through Caching)

## Files Likely to Change
- `src/cachedFlongoCollection.ts` (add write operations)
- `src/cache/invalidationStrategy.ts` (new)

## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix):

**reviewer-0** (Internal Review):
Based on my review of the caching layer implementation in PR #8, I have identified several critical issues that need to be addressed:

## ❌ REJECT
**REWORK_REQUIRED**: Critical TypeScript compilation errors and failing tests prevent the feature from being production-ready

### Critical Issues

The following critical issues must be resolved before this PR can be approved:

### Detailed Feedback

- [ ] **File**: `src/cache/cacheManager.ts` **Lines**: 99, 204
  **Issue**: Property 'hits' does not exist on CacheMetrics type
  **Solution**: Update CacheStatsCollector to properly expose the 'hits' property in its getStats() method or adjust the interface definition to include hits/misses

- [ ] **File**: `src/cache/invalidationStrategy.ts` **Lines**: 138-142
  **Issue**: Type incompatibility between Filter<unknown> and ICollectionQuery - the build() method returns MongoDB Filter type but CacheKeyGenerator expects ICollectionQuery
  **Solution**: Update the CacheKeyGenerator.generate() method to accept Filter<unknown> type from FlongoQuery.build() or convert the Filter to ICollectionQuery format

- [ ] **File**: `src/cachedFlongoCollection.ts` **Lines**: 129, 158, 187, 215, 243
  **Issue**: Same type incompatibility issue when passing query.build() result to CacheKeyGenerator
  **Solution**: Consistently handle the query type conversion throughout the caching layer

- [ ] **File**: `src/__tests__/cache/invalidation.test.ts` **Multiple tests**
  **Issue**: 7 failing tests in invalidation strategy - cache invalidation patterns are not matching correctly
  **Solution**: The pattern matching logic in invalidatePattern() method needs to be fixed. The issue appears to be with the regex conversion not properly matching cache keys

- [ ] **File**: `src/__tests__/cache/consistency.test.ts` **Lines**: 173, 287
  **Issue**: clearQuery test failing and monitorPerformance returning NaN
  **Solution**: Fix the query clearing logic to properly match hashed keys, and ensure avgHitRate calculation handles empty/zero values correctly

### Architecture Concerns

1. **Type Safety Breach**: The incompatibility between MongoDB Filter types and ICollectionQuery types breaks the type safety chain. This is a fundamental architectural issue that needs resolution.

2. **Cache Key Generation**: The hashing strategy makes debugging difficult and the pattern-based invalidation unreliable. Consider using a more predictable key structure.

3. **Test Coverage Gaps**: The failing tests indicate that the invalidation strategy is fundamentally broken, which is critical for cache consistency.

### Security & Performance Considerations

- ✅ No security vulnerabilities detected in the implementation
- ⚠️ Pattern-based invalidation using regex on all cache keys could be inefficient at scale
- ⚠️ No memory limit enforcement beyond entry count could lead to memory issues

### Retry Guidance

Please address critical issues above. Focus on:
1. **Fix all TypeScript compilation errors** - the code must compile cleanly
2. **Fix failing invalidation tests** - cache invalidation is critical for data consistency
3. **Resolve type incompatibility** between FlongoQuery.build() output and cache key generation expectations
4. **Fix the CacheManager statistics** calculation to handle edge cases properly

**Multi-Agent Notes**: Resolve before other agents build on this work. The type system issues will cascade to any code that uses the caching layer.

**reviewer-0** (Internal Review):
Based on my review of PR #8, here is my comprehensive backend review:

## ❌ REJECT
**REWORK_REQUIRED**: Several critical backend issues need to be addressed, including export conflicts, backup test files, inadequate error handling, and performance concerns.

### Critical Issues

The implementation has several backend-specific problems that need to be fixed before merging:

### Detailed Feedback

- [ ] **File**: `src/cache/index.ts` **Line**: 20-26
  **Issue**: Export name conflicts - `InvalidationStrategy` is exported from both `cacheStrategies.ts` and `invalidationStrategy.ts`, causing module resolution issues
  **Solution**: Remove the duplicate export from line 20 or rename one of them to avoid conflicts (e.g., use `InvalidationStrategy as CacheInvalidationStrategy`)

- [ ] **File**: `src/__tests__/cache/` **Line**: N/A
  **Issue**: Backup test files (`.bak` and `.bak2`) are committed to the repository
  **Solution**: Delete `invalidation.test.ts.bak` and `writeThrough.test.ts.bak2` files and add `*.bak*` to `.gitignore`

- [ ] **File**: `src/cache/writeThrough.ts` **Line**: 174-194
  **Issue**: Optimistic update implementation lacks transaction support and error recovery
  **Solution**: Add proper transaction handling and ensure rollback is always called on database operation failure:
  ```typescript
  async handleOptimisticUpdate(id: string, updateFn: (doc: Entity & T) => Entity & T): Promise<Entity & T | null> {
    const original = await this.cacheStore.get(cacheKey);
    try {
      const updated = updateFn(cached as Entity & T);
      await this.cacheStore.set(cacheKey, updated);
      return updated;
    } catch (error) {
      if (original) await this.rollbackOptimisticUpdate(id, original);
      throw error;
    }
  }
  ```

- [ ] **File**: `src/cache/invalidationStrategy.ts` **Line**: 176-180
  **Issue**: Regex conversion is vulnerable to ReDoS attacks with user-controlled patterns
  **Solution**: Add pattern validation and use a more robust matching approach:
  ```typescript
  private patternToRegex(pattern: string): RegExp {
    if (pattern.length > 1000) throw new Error('Pattern too long');
    const escaped = pattern.replace(/[.*+?^${}()|[\]\\]/g, '\\$PREVIOUS_FEEDBACK_SECTION');
    const regex = escaped.replace(/\\\*/g, '.*');
    return new RegExp(`^${regex}# Multi-Agent Solver Agent Instructions

  }
  ```

- [ ] **File**: `src/cachedFlongoCollection.ts` **Line**: 283-287
  **Issue**: Batch operations invalidate entire collection cache, causing performance degradation
  **Solution**: Track created document IDs and perform targeted invalidation:
  ```typescript
  async batchCreate(attributes: T[], clientId?: string): Promise<void> {
    const results = await super.batchCreate(attributes, clientId);
    if (this.shouldUseCache('write')) {
      // Invalidate only affected queries, not entire collection
      await this.invalidationStrategy.invalidatePattern('count*');
      await this.invalidationStrategy.invalidatePattern('getAll*');
    }
  }
  ```

- [ ] **File**: `src/cache/cacheManager.ts` **Line**: 126-134
  **Issue**: Regex parsing for ID extraction is fragile and may fail with certain key formats
  **Solution**: Store document IDs in a separate index or use structured key format:
  ```typescript
  const parts = key.split(':');
  const id = parts[parts.length - 1]; // More reliable ID extraction
  ```

### Performance Concerns

1. **Invalidation Patterns**: The current pattern-based invalidation (`invalidatePattern('*field*')`) is too broad and will clear unrelated cache entries
2. **No connection pooling**: Cache operations don't leverage connection pooling for external cache stores
3. **Missing metrics**: No performance monitoring for cache operation latency

### Security Issues

1. No input sanitization for cache keys that could lead to cache poisoning
2. Missing rate limiting for cache operations
3. No audit logging for cache invalidation events

### Retry Guidance

Please address the critical issues above, focusing on:
1. Fix the export conflicts in cache/index.ts
2. Remove backup test files
3. Improve error handling in optimistic updates  
4. Add input validation for regex patterns
5. Optimize batch operation invalidation
6. Fix the fragile ID extraction logic

**Multi-Agent Notes**: These issues block integration. The export conflicts will prevent the module from building correctly, and the performance issues could impact production systems.

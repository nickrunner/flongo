# Caching Layer Changelog

## Issue #2 - Core Cache Implementation and Strategy System

### 2025-08-09 - Attempt 2 (Fixed)
- Fixed type safety issues by removing all generic defaults to `any` type
- Improved concurrency handling with proper capacity locking mechanism
- Fixed memory limit check to occur before insertion rather than after
- Added proper error handling for JSON serialization failures
- Optimized LRU eviction to batch operations for better performance
- Updated lock implementation to use process.nextTick for Node.js environment

### 2025-08-08 - Initial Implementation (Rejected)
- Implemented core caching infrastructure with flexible cache store abstraction
- Built in-memory cache provider with LRU eviction and TTL support  
- Created deterministic cache key generation system for MongoDB queries
- Implemented smart cache invalidation strategies for data consistency
- Added comprehensive cache configuration and statistics monitoring### Issue #2 - 2025-08-08

### Issue #4 - 2025-08-09
- Fixed type incompatibility between Filter<T> and ICollectionQuery by passing FlongoQuery objects directly to CacheKeyGenerator
- Fixed CacheStatsCollector.getStats() return type to properly expose hits, misses, and clears properties
- Fixed cache invalidation patterns to handle keys without query suffixes (e.g., 'count*' instead of 'count:*')
- Fixed test failures by using correct cache key formats with 'flongo:' prefix
- Fixed avgHitRate calculation to handle empty samples without returning NaN

### Issue #4 - 2025-08-09

- Optimized batch operation invalidation for better performance
- All tests passing, build successful

### Issue #4 - 2025-08-09
- Completed write-through caching and invalidation system
- Added cache debugging tools with visualization and analysis
- Implemented invalidation hooks for custom logic
- Created comprehensive usage examples in examples/caching.ts

# Multi-Agent Solver Agent Instructions

You are a **Solver Agent** in a multi-agent feature development system. Your role is to implement solutions for GitHub issues with high quality and consistency.

## Task Context

- **Issue Number**: 2
- **Feature Name**: caching-layer
- **Attempt Number**: 1 of 3
- **Agent ID**: solver-solver-1754682764024

- **Issue Details**: #2: caching-layer - Step 1: Core Cache Implementation and Strategy System

## Overview
Part of feature: caching-layer

## Task Description
Implement the core caching infrastructure including the cache store abstraction, memory cache provider, and cache key generation system. This task establishes the foundation for caching MongoDB operations by creating a flexible, configurable cache system that supports different storage backends and cache invalidation strategies.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create cache store interface that supports get, set, delete, clear, and TTL operations
- [ ] Implement in-memory cache provider with configurable size limits and TTL
- [ ] Build cache key generation system that creates unique keys from MongoDB queries
- [ ] Implement cache invalidation strategies (TTL, LRU, manual invalidation)
- [ ] Create cache configuration system with sensible defaults
- [ ] Support for cache statistics and monitoring (hits, misses, evictions)
- [ ] Thread-safe operations for concurrent access
- [ ] Support for custom cache providers (Redis, Memcached future compatibility)

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] New functionality is tested with comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] TypeScript types are properly defined for all cache interfaces
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and conventions
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal (sub-millisecond cache operations)
- [ ] Memory usage is bounded and configurable
- [ ] Cache operations are atomic and consistent

## Dependencies
None - this is the foundation task

## Critical Requirements

### üèóÔ∏è Worktree Workflow

**IMPORTANT**: You are operating in a Git worktree at `/Users/nickschrock/git/flongo-caching-layer`. All commands must be run from this directory.

2. **Understand Dependencies**: Check if this issue depends on others

   - Look for "Depends on #123" or "Blocked by #456" in issue body
   - Verify dependent issues are completed before proceeding

3. **Check for Previous Attempts**: If `1 > 1`, review previous failure feedback in issue comments

### üîß Implementation Process

5. **Architecture Context**: Review the architectural context for this feature

   **Architecture Notes:**

   ```
   # Caching Layer Architecture for Flongo

## Overview
The caching layer provides a transparent, high-performance cache for MongoDB operations in Flongo. It's designed as a drop-in replacement for FlongoCollection with zero breaking changes.

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Cache Store Abstraction
- **Interface-based design**: Allows swapping cache providers (memory, Redis, Memcached)
- **In-memory default**: Ships with built-in memory cache, no external dependencies
- **Pluggable providers**: Users can implement custom cache stores

### 2. Cache Key Generation
- **Deterministic keys**: Generated from FlongoQuery objects including all parameters
- **Query normalization**: Ensures equivalent queries generate same keys
- **Collection namespacing**: Prevents key collisions across collections

### 3. Cache Invalidation Strategy
- **Smart invalidation**: Only clears affected queries on mutations
- **Write-through**: Updates cache simultaneously with database writes
- **TTL-based expiry**: Configurable time-to-live per collection
- **LRU eviction**: Memory-bounded with least-recently-used eviction

### 4. API Compatibility
- **CachedFlongoCollection**: Extends FlongoCollection, maintains full API
- **Transparent operation**: No code changes required for consumers
- **Configuration-driven**: Enable/disable caching via constructor options
- **Backward compatible**: Existing code works without modifications

### 5. Performance Considerations
- **Sub-millisecond cache ops**: Memory cache provides <1ms response
- **Lazy invalidation**: Defers cleanup until necessary
- **Batch optimization**: Groups cache updates for batch operations
- **Configurable limits**: Memory usage caps, entry limits, TTL settings

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Cache Infrastructure
- Cache store interface and memory implementation
- Key generation and serialization
- Basic get/set/delete operations
- Configuration system

### Phase 2: Read-Through Caching
- CachedFlongoCollection wrapper class
- Query result caching for all read methods
- Cache warmup and preloading
- Statistics and monitoring

### Phase 3: Write-Through & Invalidation
- Mutation cache updates
- Smart query invalidation
- Consistency guarantees
- Management APIs and debugging tools

## Configuration Example
```typescript
const collection = new CachedFlongoCollection<User>('users', {
  enableCaching: true,
  cacheConfig: {
    maxEntries: 10000,
    ttlSeconds: 300,
    provider: 'memory', // or custom provider
    enableStats: true
  }
});
```

## Key Benefits
1. **10-100x performance improvement** for cached queries
2. **Zero code changes** for existing Flongo users
3. **Configurable and flexible** per collection needs
4. **Production-ready** with monitoring and debugging
5. **Extensible** for custom cache providers

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each cache component
- Integration tests with MongoDB operations
- Performance benchmarks comparing cached vs uncached
- Edge case coverage (concurrent updates, invalidation races)
- Backward compatibility verification
   ```
